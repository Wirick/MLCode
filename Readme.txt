This repository contains various code that is applicable to machine learning.

I'm going to be doing some ML work now. I'm tired of getting rejected
for frontend jobs because of my weak portfolio when I don't think that
I would like the jobs in the first place. So I'm going to be doing a lot
of math, and a lot of ml fun.

The Probability Model can create uniform, single
and multivariable normal, categorical, and mixture model samples from
distributions with a specified mean and (co)variance. the plotsample.py is
a script that I wrote with plotting functions so that I could test my models
by eye. I use the Box Muller transform and the Cholesky decomposition for normal samples.
