This repository contains various code that is applicable to machine learning.

I'm going to be doing some ML work now. I'm tired of getting rejected
for frontend jobs because of my weak portfolio when I don't think that
I would like the jobs in the first place. So I'm going to be doing a lot
of math, and a lot of ml fun.

The Probability Model can create uniform, single
and multivariable normal, categorical, and mixture model samples from
distributions with a specified mean and (co)variance. the plotsample.py is
a script that I wrote with plotting functions so that I could test my models
by eye. I use the Box Muller transform and the Cholesky decomposition for normal samples.

regression.py is the skeleton for the first assignment for UC Berkeley's 2011 machine
learning course. It does k-local linear regression on a location, phase, station pair
to predict the time residual of a seismic event. other code is a precomputation procedure
to determine the k-local linear regression. It is too big for my computer to manage without
being painfully slow, so now I think I'll have to use some other trick up my sleeve to try and
work it out.

util.py contains helper functions. K-nearest neighbors, k-fold cross validation, and 
some functions created to make a toy test for my cross-validation function, which predicted
a plane nonlinear equation using nearest neighbors

plotregression.py is a visual test for my cross validation functions.
